Aiming for: Explore/SWE.
I have not taken a DSA course or class yet, but I have been teaching myself over the summer/TNT program I was in. Not sure if I am confident enough for a SWE interview or internship, but I will continue to practice and learn like I am preparing for a SWE internship (refer to DSA/CTCI schedule above).
